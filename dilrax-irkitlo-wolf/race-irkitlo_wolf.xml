			<h4>PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION</h4>
			<p>The Irkitlo Are a Animal-like bipedal cross Species between a Wolf and Fox, specifically a Fennec/Snow fox mix, other wise also known as a Folf, or Pholph when
some times written, The Irkitlo have physical characteristics of both species but depending on which species side is more dominant with in the being is the side that
defines their physical appearance and build the most but both attributes contribute to their way of life, tradition and survival with in the Mountainous Region plagued
with Spine piercing Wind, blood freezing cold and Blinding Snow storms they call their home territory, making their homes and camps among the snow covered
forests, calling both the (Ground) and (Trees) home, these Snow born hunters have thick coats of fur covering their entire body's, more so evident by the ball and
mane of fluff which covers the chest and neck but also the enormous amount of Fluff that trails behind them, this fluff both are both helpful, hindering, pleasant but
also dangerous to touch in some instances but primarily protecting them from the very harsh cold elements but helping them to camouflage when hunting during
snow blinding storms, this has also lead to the Irkitlo learning to hunt effectively using their acute hearing and keen sense of Smell with out eye sight.
they are a strictly carnivorous species often made sick by most fruits and vegetables but are able to ingest grains with minimal issue, due to this their diet mostly
consists of fish and the meat from other animals and beasts though they are not entirely picky about what kind of meat for they will eat almost anything as long as its
meat from something that was once alive, or in rare cases while alive as the Irkitlo often hunt using only their Claws and fangs instead of knives, spears and bows,
their wolf like strength giving them tremendous jaw strength and in desperate times often sinking their teeth into the flesh of prey as its caught and proceeding to not
only tear out chunks or snap bone but also start eating the torn chunks that fill their mouths, this somewhat feral of hunting utilised by the irkitlo has refined their
Physical Strength, Agility and natural weapons.</p>
